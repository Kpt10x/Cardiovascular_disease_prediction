# Cardiovascular_disease_prediction
This repository contains a Python code file for predicting cardiovascular disease using various machine learning models. The models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The project employs several preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, outlier detection and handling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Heart Failure Clinical Dataset, which includes clinical features that can be used to predict the likelihood of heart failure.

Preprocessing Techniques
1. Handling Missing Values
The dataset is checked for missing values, which are handled appropriately either by imputation or removal.

2. Outlier Detection and Handling
Outliers are detected using statistical methods and visualizations. Appropriate techniques are applied to handle outliers, such as capping or removal.

3. Feature Scaling
Features are scaled using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to bring them to a comparable range.

4. Handling Imbalanced Data with SMOTE
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to handle class imbalance by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

Models
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the predictive power of the models. This includes creating new features, transforming existing features, and selecting the most relevant features.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for each model.

Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The results are summarized and the best-performing model is highlighted.
