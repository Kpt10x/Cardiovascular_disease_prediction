Optional:
To specify exact versions and include any other dependencies, you can generate a requirements.txt using pip freeze in your environment. Here's how you can do it:
Install all the required libraries in your environment.
Run the following command in your terminal:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
This will create a requirements.txt file with all the dependencies and their versions as installed in your environment.
